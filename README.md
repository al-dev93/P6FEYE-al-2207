# FishEye project

This website for freelance photographers was designed to meet **WCAG accessibility** standards.

The photographer's page is dynamically generated using JavaScript, based on the photographer selected on the homepage.

The photographer's work is displayed in a thumbnail gallery and can be viewed individually (photographs or videos) in a lightbox containing a slider.

A like system allows users to rate each photo.
